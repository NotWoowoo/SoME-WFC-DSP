            <div class="section-body">
                <p>It seems pretty reasonable that in order to understand how to process digital audio, you must first understand what digital audio is. As you'll soon find out, digital audio is merely a category of a larger kind of digital data called signals. Signals are that new beat you spent all night working on, the readings from an EKG sensor, seismic data from geophones, and even images of cats on the internet! The point is that while this course is specifically geared towards digital audio in particular, that is far from the only application of this course's material. If you want more information on DSP's applications in image processing and data compression, I'd recommend looking through Chapters 23 to 27 of <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">Dr. Steven W. Smith's “The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing”</a>

            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; Analog vs Digital</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>What even is analog? Why does that older fellow in the music store keep insisting that his dusty old analog synthesizers sound so much warmer and natural than the modern digital trash? Does he even know what the word “analog” means? Since the D in DSP stands for “digital,” it only makes sense to start by explaining the difference. Before computers became the standard for audio processing, the main option for synthesizing and processing audio came in the form of dedicated electronic circuits. The sound waves in these circuits were represented through fluctuations of voltage over time. In other words, the fluctuations in voltage were an <i>analog</i> of the actual signal it represents (and that's why it's called "analog." The older meaning of the word "analog" is a noun and synonymous with words like "comparable" or "representation")! Since analog signals are represented by changes in energy, and physical levels of energy can't jump from one value to another in 0 units of time, the resulting signal is continuous. In other words, if you attached a polygraph machine to the source of an analog signal, and traced your finger across the resulting curve, you would never have to pick up your finger; the polygraph's position won't teleport from one position to another. To answer the question about the older fellow in the music store, there is some truth to his claim that analog synths can sound more natural. Electronic components like resistors and capacitors are prone to minor fluctuations in their current, voltage, and resistance. The result of this interference is noise which gives analog signals their characteristic warmth.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img src="img/polygraph.jpeg">
                </div>
                <p>In comparison, digital signals are discrete. Rather than a continuous curve, the polygraph would show a set of evenly spaced points for a digital sound source. This method works well for computers as you can store a digital signal pretty efficiently on a hard drive, while you would need an infinite amount of storage space to store an analog one. Since computers store signals using lists of numbers that represent sound rather than the continuous voltage signals in analog circuits, digital signals don't suffer from the same noise interference that analog signals do. Since our application is audio programming, we will only focus on digital signals from now on.</p>

            <div class="section-body">
                <p>So, what is this signal? A signal is a list of numbers over a fixed rate of time. In the case of audio, the numbers are known as the “samples” and they measure the “amplitude” at each sample's point in time. Typically, amplitude is denoted as a decimal value between -1 and 1. The way I like to think about amplitude is by imagining the cone of a speaker. An amplitude of 1 means the cone is pushed all the way out, and -1 is pulled all the way in. From the rapid movement of the cone's position over time, you get sound. The fixed rate of time is known as the “sample rate”, which is commonly measured in samples per second. The most common sample rate in music is 44.1khz, or 44,100 samples per second.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; Bit Depth and the "Retro" Sound</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>Computers, and especially older ones, have a hard time accurately storing non-whole numbers. Since a digital audio signal's values are non-whole numbers by nature, that creates a limitation on how precise each value can be. In DSP, this precision is known as the “Bit Depth” of a digital signal. The bit depth is merely the amount of bits required to hold said number (<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/bits-bytes.html">Here</a> is a good resource to understanding bits and binary numbers). Most modern digital audio workstations use a standard bit depth of 32 bits, meaning that there are 2<sup>32</sup> possible values a sample can have between -1 and 1. Converting to lower bit depths forces samples' amplitudes to be quantized (snapped to the closest intermediate value). The effect of this is a noiser audio signal that sounds characteristically "retro" (since old hardware had lower bit depths).</p>

        <div class="dropdown child-dropdown">
            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; What is Frequency?</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>Until now, we have only been looking at digital audio in the time domain (where time is the horizontal axis of the graph), but a great deal of information can be dissected from the frequency domain as well. To introduce frequency, let's think about this cat spinning on a record player.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <img src="img/cat-spin.gif">
                </div>
                <p>We can measure the “frequency” by finding how many times the cat makes a full rotation per unit time. The standard unit for frequency is the hertz (hz), or cycles/second. Since the cat is spinning on a 33 rpm (revolutions per minute) record, we can find the revolutions per second by dividing 33 by 60. Therefore, we can find that the cat is spinning at a frequency of 0.55 hz, or roughly one full rotation for every 1.8 seconds.</p>
                <p>The best equivalent to this spinning cat in the world of DSP is the sine wave. Much like the GIF of the cat, sine waves are periodic, or repeat infinitely in a very predictable manner. Because of this property, we can measure a sine wave's frequency in a similar way. The frequency of a sine wave is 1 divided by the “period” of the wave, or the time it takes to complete one cycle.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <div id="frequencyDesmosCalc" class="calculator" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

        <div class="dropdown child-dropdown">
            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; What is Phase?</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>While frequency is the amount of cycles per second, phase is the starting position of the cycle. Phase is measured in either degrees or radians depending on the context (in this section we use degrees). Yet again, let's think about these <i>two</i> gifs of cats spinning on a record player.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center overflow-hidden">
                    <img src="img/cat-spin-phase-1.gif">
                    <img src="img/cat-spin-phase-2.gif">
                </div>
                <p>Both cats are spinning at the same frequency, and both GIFs are 28 frames long, but what differentiates the two felines is their starting position on the first frame. Cat number one starts facing the camera, while cat number two starts by facing away from the camera. In DSP terms, we would say that these cats are “out of phase” with each other. Now, compare that to these cats below.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center overflow-hidden">
                    <img src="img/cat-spin-phase-3.gif">
                    <img src="img/cat-spin-phase-3.gif">
                </div>
                <p>This time, the cats are “in phase” with each other because they start at the same point in their cycle around the record player. In the context of DSP, signals that are added together can either interfere constructively or destructively depending on each signal's respective phases. If you play around with the graph below, you'll see how the individual sine waves constructively interfere when they are at the same phase, and weaken the signal the more they differ. If you put one wave at 0 degrees, and the other at 180 degrees, the two waves cancel each other out completely (this phenomenon has the convenient name of “phase cancellation”).</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; Everything is Sine Waves!</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>For those who have seen less idealistic audio signals, you'll know that you'll very rarely have something as clean as a sine wave. For these cases, there's no way to measure frequency in the same way we did the perfect sine wave. The key insight comes when we start thinking of signals of having <i>multiple</i> frequencies instead. This idea comes from a subject in math known as Fourier Analysis, named after French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier. What Fourier tells us is that any signal (analog or digital) can be decomposed into a series (sum) of sinusoidal waves of ascending frequency. The first term will be the “DC component”, or a flat line that represents the average amplitude of the signal, and each succeeding term is a sinusoidal wave of a certain amplitude and phase (starting position in the cycle). In some cases, this sum can be infinite, but for digital signals, there is a finite limit (this idea will be explored when we talk about the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). What the frequency domain shows us is the amplitude of a signal as a function of the corresponding sinusoidal component at each frequency. Since saying “the corresponding sinusoidal components at each frequency” is a mouthful, the more common term is “the frequencies of the signal”. If you got all of that, great job! Take a breath knowing that you now understand the (rather dated) meme below.</p>

        <div class="dropdown child-dropdown">
            <h3 class="section-title">&#8594; The Vocabulary of Frequency</h3>
            <div class="section-body">
                <p>As we briefly touched on in the previous section, a lot of language surrounding frequency and the frequency domain is abstracted from the actual concepts. The ideas of harmonics, pitch, and timbre are intimately tied with the idea of frequency, even if the hobbyist musician doesn't necessarily think of them in this way. For example, if you ever hear a musician talking about “harmonics”, they are merely talking about what you know as the frequency components of a sound. For any given sound, there is a “fundamental” harmonic/frequency, which is the lowest frequency of a sound, and then its “overtones”, or subsequent harmonics above the fundamental. The “pitch” of a sound is determined by the frequency of the fundamental, while the timbre (a fancy french word for the <i>sound</i> of a sound) is determined by the overtones of a sound. In the example below, you can add overtones to a fundamental sine wave and watch the signal morph into what is called a “square wave”, which is a signal that regularly alternates between a positive and negative value, such that the signal is positive 50% of the time and negative the other 50% of the time.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <div id="squareDesmosCalc" class="calculator" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Below is a similar example, but this time, the harmonics added turn the fundamental sine wave into a “sawtooth wave”, which is given its name by how it looks like the teeth of a saw blade.</p>
                <div class="flex justify-center">
                    <div id="sawtoothDesmosCalc" class="calculator" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>
                </div>
                <p>So what makes these signals look different? In the case of the sawtooth wave, the overtones are added at every integer multiple of the fundamental frequency, at an amplitude of 1 divided by the number of the harmonic (the first overtone will be half as strong as the fundamental, the second will be one third, and so on). For the square wave, only the harmonics with a frequency with an odd multiple of the fundamental are added. For more complicated sounds, such as guitars and pianos, these harmonics will be much less orderly than basic shapes such as square and sawtooth waves, and are subject to change over time. For example, the start of a piano has a lot of high frequency content as the mallet hits the string, but over time, those higher harmonics are dampened out.</p>

        Same with square waves
        user can try subtracting a saw wave one octave higher from the original saw wave
        OR can add the harmonics manually
